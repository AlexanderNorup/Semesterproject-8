# ESP32 Code

This code is based on the "Gatt Security Server" example found at https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/bluetooth/bluedroid/ble/gatt_security_server

This project requires the ESP-IDF toolkit to be installed. Please refer to the Espressif guide for installation instructions on your system: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html

If using the [Visual Studio Code exxtension](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/tutorial/install.md) for development, make sure to copy the `.vscode/settings.json.example` and configure it so it points to the installation-instruction of your toolchain.
